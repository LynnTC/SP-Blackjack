# Scott Pilgrim Blackjack

A simple game of 21 or blackjack with theming after the show Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, though does include elements from other Scott Pilgrim media.

Rules are mostly the same as traditional Blackjack. Try to get close or reach 21 without going over, face cards are worth 10 and aces are worth 11 or 1.
The goal is to beat the dealer. The dealer always has to hit below 17 and dealer's aces can only be worth 11.
Win to gain 2x your original bet, if you tie you can play again with the same bet, and if you lose it's gone.
Doubling will double your original bet but you have to draw one more card and stay at what it lands.
